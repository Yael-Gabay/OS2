# OS2
In this exercise we were asked to deal with the SIMPLE HTTP communication protocol, a protocol which is actually a very limited version of HTTP.
This protocol contains two instructions GET and POST.
## Part 1- server:
We were asked to write a server that supports this protocol.
The server receives only one parameter (in argv) describing the root directory of the server. The server supports multiple simultaneous downloads using multiple processes.
